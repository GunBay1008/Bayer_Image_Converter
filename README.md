Setting up the Project
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to work within a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate your project's environment. We'll use Conda for this purpose. If you don't have Conda installed, you can download and install it from the official website.

bash
Copy code
conda create --name myenv
conda activate myenv
Replace myenv with your preferred environment name.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you are in the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Step 3: Navigate to Project Directory
Navigate to the directory where your project files are located:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Replace path/to/your/project with the actual path to your project directory.

Step 4: Run the Main Script
Once you've set up the virtual environment and installed the dependencies, you can run the main script of your project:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This command will execute the main.py script, which presumably contains the main functionality of your project.
